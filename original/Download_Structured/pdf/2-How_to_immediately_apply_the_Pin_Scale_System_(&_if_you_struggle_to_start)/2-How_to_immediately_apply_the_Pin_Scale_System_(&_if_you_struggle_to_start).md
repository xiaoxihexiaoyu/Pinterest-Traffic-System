# 2-How to immediately apply the Pin Scale System (if you struggle to start)

**文档摘要：** 本页说明 Pin Scale System(PSS) 提供每个关键任务的 SOP，可边做边对照，或直接交给助理执行。其他模块用于补充背景与工具配置，帮助建立高效的周计划流程。建议新手从“Core Task Roadmap”入手，优先完成三步：基础搭建(Overview Sheet+Google Drive)、核心任务SOP、算法理解；其余模块可后续逐步阅读，工具集中在 Pin Tool Kit 与 Additional Tools & Automation。

The PSS is designed to provide you with a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for every (important)
task in this business, you can find them here.
You'll find individual SOPs for each step, as well as a compiled version containing all of them. These
SOPS are intended to assist you in your work; for example, you can open them on a separate screen
while doing one of these tasks to ensure you're completing the task in the most efficient way possible.
OR
You can delegate individual tasks or even the entire strategy to a VA.
All other modules serve to explain these workflows and tasks in more detail. They provide you with
important background information and help you set up a highly efficient workflow that fits into your weekly
schedule.
Additionally, they assist you in setting up the tools and show you how to best integrate them.
If you don't know where to start, start here:
The PinScaleSystem is structured so that right at the beginning you’ll see the “Core Task Roadmap.”
These are the Core Tasks - the most important actions that drive 80% of the results.
For each one, you’ll get our exact step-by-step workflow (SOPs).
I’d recommend going through them one by one and then putting those workflows into action. As additional
key modules, I’d suggest:
Fundamental Setup (this helps you get properly organized once and for all)
About Pinterest’s Algorithm (a clear breakdown of how the algo actually works)
That’s really all you need to start:
1. Go through Fundamental Setup (use the Overview Sheet + Google Drive for efficient organization)
2. Use the SOPs for your core tasks
3. If you want, also read About Pinterest’s Algorithm
With just those three steps, you’ll be well set up to get started quickly and effectively.
All the other modules go much deeper and explain the processes in more detail, but you don’t need them
right away - you can go through them gradually later.
You’ll find all the tools both inside the Pin Tool Kit and under Additional Tools & Automation.
