# 107-What's the maximum number of pins I can safely upload each day

---
## Page 1

For new or less established accounts, I recommend starting with 8–12 pins per day. 
If your account is already established and has good engagement rates, you can test 15–25 pins per day 
—but always prioritize quality over quantity! 
Always Remember: Save Rate & Engagement Matter 
Pinterest prioritizes engagement and save rates! 
Uploading too many pins—especially low-performing ones—will lower your account’s average 
engagement rate which results in a decline in your overall visibility. 
Why Too Many Pins Can Hurt Performance 
Pinterest’s algorithm categorizes and ranks pins using machine learning. 
Overloading the system with too many pins at once can reduce the tagging accuracy (e.g., 
annotations and interests). 
This results in fewer impressions and weaker performance for all pins on your account. 
Old vs. New Pinterest Strategy 
A few months ago, Pinterest showed all pins to your followers (regardless of how many pins you've 
uploaded), so accounts with high follower counts had a big advantage. 
Now, Pinterest only shows a subset of pins based on algorithmic recommendations. That 
makes high-quality pins more important than ever. 

#### Additional Tip:

Rather than focusing solely on volume, invest time in keyword research, optimized and catchy pin titles, 
descriptions, and visually compelling designs. 
This ensures each pin contributes positively to your account’s overall performance.
