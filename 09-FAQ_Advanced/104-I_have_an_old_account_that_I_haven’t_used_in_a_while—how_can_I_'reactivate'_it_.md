#### To reactivate an old Pinterest account, follow these steps:

1. Audit and Clean Up 
Rename existing boards to align with your niche or current focus. 
[Keyword Research before that] 
Remove low-performing boards (check analytics for boards with no to low impressions, you can 
check out our process here). 
2 Optimize Your Profile 
Update your profile picture, bio, and website link. 
Make sure your bio includes 3-5 relevant keywords but avoids KW stuffing. 
Add board descriptions with relevant annotations (automate this with our generator). 
3. Create Fresh Boards 
Add new boards with new KW variants. 
Use specific and keyword-rich names for the boards (e.g., "Quick Dinner Recipes" instead of 
"Recipes"). 
4. Consistent Pinning 
Start small: Pin 8-12 pins/day for the first week or two. 
Gradually increase to 20-30 pins daily, ensuring each pin has a unique design and optimized 
description. 
5. Post New Content 
Focus on creating high-quality pins for your most popular or evergreen blog posts. 
Research the best-performing pins before you create new ones. 
Use the best-performing pin designs like text overlays, collage designs, or plain images. 
6. Engage with Others 
Save relevant pins from other accounts to your boards. 
Follow and engage with accounts in your niche to send positive activity signals to Pinterest. 
7. Analyze and Adapt 
Monitor your Pinterest analytics weekly and once a month in-depth. 
Especially focus on your save and engagement rates. 
Double down on boards or pin designs that gain traction. 

#### Info:

If your account was inactive for a long time, it might take 2-3 months of consistent effort to see results.
